      # Note that this only merges in changes that happened on the last build on
      # preview/${{ github.head_ref }}. It's possible that there are OAS/config
      # changes that haven't been built, if the preview-sdk job didn't finish
      # before this step starts. In theory we want to wait for all builds
      # against preview/${{ github.head_ref }} to complete, but assuming that
      # the preview-sdk job happens before the PR merge, it should be fine.
